## TODO - Tuesday, 19/01/2016
- The edit and add forms are jacked up
- They'll need a complete overhaul before we can deploy
- Probably split them up into two separate components

- Also the weird stuff you do with the URl on add has to go

- Show errors when you can't save/upload!


- MAke it so you can handle webm uploads
- Modify the elements to handle not having the gif field always filled out
- 



is imgur, is gif? Done
is imgur, not gif? Strip the gifv -> gif done
not imgur, not gif? Upload it as a webm only
not imgur, is gif? Upload to Imgur
